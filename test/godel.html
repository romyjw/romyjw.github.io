<header><h1>G<span>&#246;</span>del's Theorems: A Bird's Eye View</h1></header>
<hr>
<div class="defaultpage">
<p>I wrote this article in an attempt to distill the most essential part of the argument of 
G<span>&#246;</span>del's famous proof. It is based on my reading and interpretation of
<i>G<span>&#246;</span>del's Proof</i> (by Nagel and Newman) - which I very highly recommmend. The mechanics of G<span>&#246;</span>del Numbering are super neat in my opinion (and also not that hard to understand), but for the purposes of understanding the main argument, it's enough to consider G<span>&#246;</span>del Numbering as a 'black box' system for labelling arithmetical statements - kind of like a barcode.</p>

<p>So far I only talk about the First Incompleteness Theorem (concerning the provability of statements). When I get the chance, I will put a follow up article here, about the Second Incompleteness Theorem (concerning consistency of formal systems).</p>
