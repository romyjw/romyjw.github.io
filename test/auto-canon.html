<h2>Desmos</h2>
<p>When I was ill in bed earlier this year, I found out that my favourite easy-to-use online graphing calculator has introduced a SOUND feature, and I was incredibly excited. So I spent my convalescence writing the Frere Jacque function, with automatic transposition into major and minor keys. You can then play the Frere Jacque function forwards and backwards, superposed with itself and translated. I.e., all the most common variations of a canon. The plan was to also do the Crab Canon. But this method of transcription is... quite tedious, and I never got around to it.</p>
