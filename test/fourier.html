<h2>A Fourier Machine</h2>
<p>This is very vague so far, but the rotating circles formulation makes me certain that there is a way to construct a machine to draw these shapes. It would likely use cogs. It would be something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph">spirograph</a> on steroids (aside: the spirograph is an amazing toy).</p>
<p>If it were to ever be remotely useful, except as a cool novelty, then the radii of the circles/ cogs would need to be adjustable.</p>
<p>Clearly I haven't worked it out yet, but it's a very exciting thought experiment.</p>
