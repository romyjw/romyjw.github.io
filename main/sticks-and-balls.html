<header><h1>A Serendipitous Stellated Icosahedron</h1></header>
<hr>
<div class="defaultpage">
<p>I am a huge enthusiast for &mdash; to avoid using any brand names here &mdash; `magnetic sticks and balls'. I always liked these while I was growing up. Then, when I was studying Topology in 2nd year maths, I saw Simplicial Complexes for the first time and I was instantly reminded of the toy. So I bought myself a small set for my desk. And a matching set for my sister (a fellow topology enthusiast). Then I wasn't satisfied with making only <i>half</i> a stellated icosahedron, so I extended the collection further... </p>
<p>One of the best things about my recent visit to the Mathematische Forschunginstitute Oberwolfach, was that there were enough magnets to build <i>two huge conjoined stellated icosahedra</i>.</p>

<p>My PhD supervisor Niloy has further fuelled my addiction by allowing me to purchase a 668-piece set on eBay, "for the lab". I want to build as many of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_solid" target="blank">Archimedean Solids</a> as possible. The ones with octagons and decagons pose a structural challenge.</p>

<p>At one point, I thought I might have exhausted the list of geometrically interesting models I could actually make with the miniature desktop set. Then I was idly modifying my stellated icosahedron (possibly my favourite shape to make) and to my surprise I found that I had made... a regular dodecahedron? Sure, I know that the regular dodecahedron is the dual of an icosahedron, but I could not see any particular reason why the points of the icosahedron's `stellation' spikes should be separated by exactly the length of one magnet.</p>

</div>


<p>After one very distracted day when I kept playing with this on my desk instead of doing my actual research, I realised that this construction of a dodecahedron from a stellated icosahedron is only possible because certain sets of edges form pentagrams (that are flat/ lie in a plane). And this is only possible because the ratio between the lengths of the two brands of `stick' is <i>more or less exactly*</i> the Golden Ratio, \(\phi = \frac{1+ \sqrt{5}}{2}\)!**</p>
<p>So I will call the base shape, a `Serendipitous Stellated Icosahedron'.</p>

<p><i>*More or less exactly</i> is not a strictly mathematical caveat, unlike similar phrases such as <i>almost everywhere</i>. I just mean that it's close enough to make the model so that it a) looks good if you don't look too close, and b) doesn't fall apart.</p>
<p>**The exclamation mark indicates excitement and surprise; it does not represent anything to do with factorials or gamma functions.</p>

<p>Apologies if you associate pentagrams with witchcraft or something, and you don't like that. Here is a proof that the ratio of the lengths in question must be \(\phi\).</p>

<!-- <p>One final fun fact, if you came along so far: at the time of writing, a child playing with `sticks and balls magnets' is still the first image on the Wikipedia page for a certain form of neurodivergence. IBe accepting. Be proud of who you are.</p>-->
