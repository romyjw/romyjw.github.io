<header><h1>This Model Should Be Impossible to Build</h1></header>

<p>I am a huge enthusiast for - to avoid using any brand names here - `magnetic sticks and balls'. I liked this toy when I was growing up, but I never had enough to make any very interesting models. Then, when I was studying Topology in 2nd year maths (during lockdown) I saw Simplicial Complexes for the first time, and I was instantly reminded of the toy. So I bought myself a desktop set. And a matching set for my sister (a fellow topology enthusiast). Then I wasn't satisfied with only <i>half</i> a stellated icosahedron, so I extended the collection further... </p>
<p>I felt like a had gone to heaven when I found this enourmous set at the Mathematische Forcscunginstitute Oberwolfach, where I had enough to build <i>two conjoined stellated icosahedra</i>, with plenty left to spare!</p>

<p>My PhD supervisor Niloy has further fuelled my addiciton by allowing me to purchase a 668-piece set "for the lab" (from eBay).</p>

<p>However, despite my extensive experience playing with these toys, I was taken completely by surprise when I was idly modifying my stellated icosahedron (possibly my favourite shape to make) and I found that I had made... a regular dodecahedron? Sure, I know that the regular dodecahedron is the dual of an icosahedron, but I could not see any particular reason why the points of the icosahedron's 'stellation' spikes should be separated by exactly the length of one magnet.</p>

<p>After one very distracted day in which I barely got around to any of my proper research, I realised that this construction of a dodecahedron from a stellated icosahedron is only possible because certain edges form pentagrams, which is only possible because the ratio between the lengths of the two brands of `stick' is <i>more or less exactly*</i> the Golden Ratio, \(\phi = \frac{1+ \sqrt{5}}{2}\)!**</p>
<img src="../images/pentagram.jpeg" alt="" >
<p><i>*More or less exactly</i> is not a strictly mathematical caveat, unlike similar phrases such as <i>almost everywhere</i>. I just mean that it's close enough to make the model so that it a) looks good if you don't look too close, and b) doesn't fall apart.</p>
<p>**The exclamation mark indicates excitement and surprise; it does not represent anything to do with factorials or gamma functions.</p>

<p>Apologies if you associate pentagrams with witchcraft or something, and you don't like that. Here is a proof that the lengths in question must be \(\phi\).</p>
